"Resting at home is a nice way to begin the season of you. No put on gold this week and hold close your loved ones. Eat doughnuts, figs, and raisins. Stand in the rain, the real rain, the trees are blissful and new."
"You have a very gentle way of telling the truth. Maybe you think it's a lie not to just say what you are thinking. It's not a lie, it's kindness. Even if they act as if they don't appreciate it, they do."
"When you sing your song you do it better than anyone. If you give the song to others they won't know how to sing it, but maybe they will figure it out. Your best role is when you teach others to sing their own songs. Do that."
"Your heart will follow you wherever you go. Even if you go to the moon your heart will find you and remind you of home. The heart doesn't believe in obligation either. Thank the blue-green stems, the sea. Thank the green ocean."
You are having some trouble at work. Not everyone knows what a genius you are. Sometimes charm is about selling something you think is obviously the best. In fact that's what it's always about.
"Even when things aren't your fault, you get scared you will get blamed again. You care very deeply how you are seen and thought of by others. You can't control their imagination. But you can go there and dance. Always."
"A time of transformation has now begun to take too long. There is the honey and the lemon, but then there is the horse. Everything was easier three weeks ago, maybe. We don't need to tell you--you're strong."
Buy as many pink flowers as you can and put them everywhere. Draw pictures of pink roses and give them to acquaintances. Dress your expressions up with pink flowers and become one. There is a lesson in waiting. It's true.
"This week will be very taxing in the amount of work you will be expected to do. As usual, you will do it without that much complaining. You will ask though, is this all there is? Of course not. Your gifts are very much appreciated. They all worship you."
so start the one you want to be having.
"Meditate this week on lizards. They are resourceful and beautiful and look great in a backdrop of sunset and extra hot pink. So do you, but that's not exactly the point. They move fast when they need to. That's you, too."
"You finally got some shit together this week and are feeling more focused, more ready for new things to happen. By midweek you will feel like a bud ready to burst into pink and orange flower. It's starting to be your time again."
All of your investments will leak out more of themselves in a way that makes more growth than you can fathom. Is this good. Oh yes!
"Pretending just isn't your thing but showing only one side surely is. Can you slant the truth so much it's sideways. It's so simplistic to love the ocean flowers and things, but you do."
"Your favorite thing is the music made just for you by someone who knows you very deeply. But have you let anyone see into the place that makes the song. If it has been a while, begin again."
You want an ocean full of crashing cold and delicious waves. But the water is delicate. The way is decisive. You are deciding if you will be the electric lights that hang in the entryway. Come on--like you'd ever let anyone keep you still.
Green on green becomes a yellow tint. Put on your sunshine coat and walk and walk and when you come to the hill do not doubt the snow--welcome it.
"There is a shower of sparkles that is infinite and infinitely large and it will fall over your shoulders with the scent of roses and there will be a soft bed and in it will be orange juice. You are very well, kind, and purposeful, and we need you."
You are doing so many beautiful things and you should keep doing them. Sometimes you worry what the point or the purpose is and you want to be more cautious. Don't think about that now. Wear everything that's orange.
Steady is the course of the one who plans. Steady is the way of the one who sees the way. Steady is the wind that knew where to go. Steady is the light that saw an opening.
"It's too much fun to believe you have your hands in so many hearts. But what about your own. I mean, who is pulling the strings. Don't walk, run, when they walk in the door. Run to them--they are the answer."
"This week will bring you so much over the top overflowing buckets of love and money. You will see thru the fog to a new path, one made just for you with emeralds and moss and mint ice cream. If you feel like it, sing."
"You demand so much respect because you are so damn respectful. Hardly any other sign could do the things that you do, let alone another person. When you feel weak remember you are endless."
"In your dreams you see a closed road, an old story, your old fears. In your everyday you are a person moving and growing. It's not that the dream world isn't real it's that you are."
"You've been away, not traveling necessarily in your body, but in your spirit. You've been going this way and that and now you might say where is home. It's where the cats are. All the lions, who break the silence with their own wandering."
"You are used to getting your way, no matter what. But this week will bring you someone who is too much like you to give in. Maybe you are in love with them. It's never too late to change your mind. You're a way too wild spirit to give in to stubbornness."
You are very good at saying when you need a break. But this week you will be worried about telling everyone you need a rest. Perhaps this is because you know people need you so much. Remember the silver stars. Remember the green stars.
"Even though you believe in many chances for everyone else, you only allow yourself one chance to get it right. Be a best friend to yourself. This is the real thing and it does matter what you do. But in your effort for excellence, remember magic, too."
You are having fun. This is not exactly the time to be having fun. But who is brave enough to stop you. You will keep moving and moving towards laughter like comedy is your new religion. Do you even believe in humor. You tell us.
"A memory stings. Is it that it's gone and couldn't happen again. Or is it that you worry you won't be that person again. The latter isn't true. You are still that person. Even today. You will be that person tomorrow, too."
"You're still in a state of turmoil, trying to know which direction to go. You don't have to decide just yet. It's more important now to collect data, analyze what might be the right choice. You don't have to do anything before you're ready. Soon you will be."
"The goal isn't just to win the argument. It is also to make the points you need to make about the moon. Do you want to sing against a hill? If you do, you can. But it's more fun, more ethical, to surround with love. The ones who matter will see your point."
"Despite some setbacks, your career has achieved some much-needed focus by a few good things coming your way. Try to stay calm--things will work out eventually. Have you seen the orange lake yet? If not, open the door. It's right there, fresh with a kiss."
"You aren't surprised when you change course, but almost everyone else is. They mean well, when they try to bring you back into focus. Oh what do they know. Nothing worthwhile ever happened by unhappily sticking to it. Your goal should be to be happy."
"This week a good investment might be a nice blanket. After you get it, run as fast as you can to your bed with it. Come up periodically to invite people to go under the covers with you. Otherwise forget about your to-do list. We will see you next Sunday."
You are known for your impulsivity. But sometimes you can be downright reckless. That is especially where your emotions are concerned. How do you really feel is a good question to ask yourself constantly. Because it's fun not to care. But what if you do.
What is it about improvisation that makes people assume there is no earlier thought when a thing is out of control. Or more that what is it about passion that makes people think that it requires no planning. They must not know you.
this week they will see.
"What is about the winter that makes everyone want to talk about birds. Maybe they miss them, their entry so deep into the spring. Maybe you carry the strongest snowbird in your own beak. They sing and sing to welcome more snow. It's a beginning."
You will feel drawn to blue in many ways that feel desperately out of character. You will feel an urge to buy a lapis and you must do so. You will draw a picture of a sunset dressed up in blue tones. You will realize an ending is prettier this way.
"birth, kissing, cake."
You bought several small lights and then forgot how to turn them on. So you wrote your novel in the night to an unnamed admirer. They read it but only in the dream where you drive and wake up not driving. If you turn on the light you'll see.
You are taking direct action from the center. Honestly honestly. Honestly what could be better than that. Everyone says to eat spinach but you actually like it. Everyone says to be kind but you actually must do so. Put your arm in a curve. You hold the air.
We call it a lake or sea or an ocean or a river. You call everything moon song and that's a good thing. You paint a very big sun on your shirt and call it a self-portrait. You take a picture. It's of a train. That's the real you.
You were very tired for a while then you rested now you feel real again. Maybe you work too much. Love is the real work and you do too much of that too maybe. No the real reason you felt tired is that you need to wear more red. These days will be happy.
"You lost something then you found it again. You forgot about the heartbreak then it came up again like the most vivid light. You have your own. Burst forth more brightly than it ever could with purple and violet, the lilac sparks. Nothing is ever lost."
The heart of the matter is not your problem. Your tendency to weaken does involve your own feelings--it matters that a heart is not kept in a swarm of trees. When you tried that one time to forget them that didn't work either. And it certainly won't now.
"Now is not the time for dancing and playing and pink streamers. Be frugal. When instinct calls you to excess, remember to excessively open the heart to the ones who matter. Live fully with your dreams set upon the real sun."
"You owe someone a gift and you know it. It doesn't have to be a big deal, but you don't want to forget to give it. It's not even that the other person will care, but you will eventually. Sugar sugar sugar--is that really all there is?"
"You've been waiting for this day for so long. You've been collecting these thoughts, kept meticulously in a small bin. Now is the day. You can take them out and examine them. You will find it all thrilling. And sad."
Is it more important to be in control than to be in a state of growth. The answer seems obvious to some but not to you. In truth there is no right answer. How do the trees in the wind at night speak to you? That's your answer.
"When you like something it's like a set of nerves, or maybe just one nerve, or not a nerve at all but a song about what nerves feel for you. Everything wants to be that thing for you. But after a long walk in the rain you want to go inside. Oh do it."
Everyone asks you to reach up as high as you can to get the oranges from the trees. Nevermind you have to find the trees and a way to climb them. They think you are the only one who can reach them. You make people feel things. Love is on its way.
"You can be quite patient and you have been very patient lately with someone who is rather patient, too. In all of this patience, where is the passion? Oh it's there, you can be certain of that. Just ask a little and it will flood out from everywhere."
"Time has been expanding lately, as you have been prepared to fit so many moments into one. It's not your job though to move time. Take your own days as they happen so soft and slow. It's not your job to make the sun rise for someone. Easy and slow now, go."
Blue is a thing  that gives a little start. Wear something metallic and blue and think about the future. The future is a blue stone that always contain an eye. The eye you see out of shows you the sea. This week the people you know will embrace your ideas.
Someone close to you has given you a job opportunity and you are ready to take it very seriously. No one else is surprised by this but maybe you are. You have boiled the flowers down and now all you have to do is drink the scent. Don't worry so much now.
"Wear green then splash whiskey on your neck. Learn to float when no one is looking and then when they do, float so gently it does look like you are bragging. Take every piece of glitter and coat your hair. You're pure luck and chance. You've got this."
The bells are beautiful and bright and they ring and ring. Find someone to love and love them forever. That's your goal so why not just go after it now. By the end of the month the bells will ring a little less. But love like yours lasts a lifetime.
"Is it night vision you are after? To see the eye itself as a lake. No, you cooked the oranges from the tree and made an orange pie. And when the person showed up and flashed that orange square how giddy you got. Get over it."
"When a movie ends it feels like everything is connecting, all the stray parts of the plot have to find a way to weave together. When there is only 5 minutes left it better end with grace. Tomorrow doesn't have to be a movie. Don't connect. Live."
"There is a series of green hills in different sizes. You aren't near them. They don't exist. There are hills near where you pass each day, on the way. Nothing exists. There are hills. There will be a new love. Bright and everlasting. Rejoice."
"If the general light brings clarity, then a pink light is more than just the dawn. You have been saving up for this moment for many years. No not money, but your emotions. Write them down and they will be read. By everyone. That's your dream."
"You will sigh and feel sorry for all the signs as they come to you. You won't think they are trying to tell you anything. You don't think they are for you. Step back. They are signs and you see them. Do you remember the song, as well as they do."
You do so much to appear tough. You are. You are. The opposite of strength is not weakness. Eat a pear. Eat a peach cake. This week will be a culmination of everything. Don't sleep too much. Eat a pear cake.
"You will want to leave your house a lot and you should. There are people who wait for you not at all the old places, but the new one. They want to tell you things and what they say will change your mind. And you will need their kindness. Put on a red scarf."
"A trip to a mountain is coming to an end. Are you going down the mountain? No. They tell you, no. The trip was perfect, perfect and still. These days answered a question. Which question? Both."
You balance the glass egg against the amethyst. Is it really a surprise to you. You balance the light of the room with the light of the hall. The books are in the open space. The silences. They call.
"When you offer up everything most everyone will take each piece from you. Only some will even know what they are doing. There are only the most gentle who will stop and push you thru the door. Where there is a purple stream, music, and you can be alone."
You pretend to be the fair one. You pretend to follow the patterns and the recipe. You pretend to stay the course as you should. But what you want to do is leave the house and run into the thunderous night. If only for an instant. Of course you'll be back.
The turns of the wind make the air colder and the wind turns and cracks the surface of itself. You say to keep walking. And you walk. And you walk. And you walk. Then you walk some more. The person who lets you keep walking is not your friend.
"There are so many birds outside your window at night, so why do you only think about them in the morning. Surrounding you are all those old thoughts you forget are there, too. It's time to shake them free. You are new."
"This week will bring you the most peaceful nights of sleep. You will dream of purple fields and will run through them gently, free of reason. When you wake you will eat soup and spaghetti thru a kind stomach. You will meet your old friends and embrace."
In the room by the little light when you laugh you are very nearly the most beautiful we see you and smile and shake much is said about charm charm is not the stars or the snakes you are neither you will have a nice few days full of money and friends.
"Time is sexy. Time is seductive. It keeps moving, they say. In regulated regards to nothing. Time is the moon that keeps going and going. They say when you think about it it doesn't move. Time is like having sex with sex itself. It's true."
The more submerged you submit to the word the more the words contain infinite possibilities. Isn't that what everyone says you want. No what you want is the sun to rise and rise and rise. What you want is to love. And you will.
What is it about the sphere that tells the past and future. What is it about the circle that contains the present with its feathers. What is it about regret that makes us go so deeply into an alternate reality. What is it about reality that makes us weep.
The bed and its blankets keeps you warm. It also keeps you inside. When you are feeling fine under the red blankets you can feel infinity. But it's ok to say infinity exists elsewhere. It's ok to leave the house and go find someone.
"One day this week wake up at 3am and eat pie. Then think of the first three words that come to your mind. They are part of a letter to your future self, so take the time now and write it. This week will bring you whiskey, poetry, and kindness."
"You can seem unbreakable to everyone around you. A constant source of strength and energy. But when you turn away from all those needs, you face the parts of you that need the strength of others. There are people who want to be there for you--just ask."
You have many good friends but now is the time to remember a person completely on your side. They might be considered a best friend but that's too simple a term. They give you support in so many silent ways. Now is the time to be loud and thank them.
"Things are happening not completely out of the realm of possibility but at a faster pace than you could have predicted, or liked. But you shouldn't be sad--there is reason to celebrate. You carry with you the bright lights and they will show you the way."
"A plant does not just come from the ground--it exists because of the air. There are at least twenty daffodils that sit now in your room. Are they cut and in the glass or have you made a place for them to grow? And if they grow, will they grow forever?"
"It's hard to imagine a reality where the small things don't consume a mind at some point. But for every small instance there is a small wonder. When the light throbs with more light, remember the pact with yourself you made so long ago."
"2018 will bring you trips back home, a wild essay, modern sculpture, a sibling, a sink full of new coffee cups, a Cancer true love, an interesting talk in the morning, words that have no meaning, green jewels, a cat, endless vacation, gifts from the past."
"2018 will bring you toys, books about moods, manuals about manuals, a Libra on your good side, a swan made out of paper, a time with only truth, striped shirts, sex so good it's unimaginable until it happens, running, trips to the ocean, pure music."
"2018 will bring you a cave where everything is a strange bee, flowers in the car, a very sturdy cloak, minimal wear and tear, tea, irises, a Pisces lovesong, movement, oils, dogs, the rain, chocolate."
"2018 will bring you vision, really delicious pizza, glamorous encounters, job offers, fun at family events, a Taurus who loves you, friends who give you expensive jackets, an investment, options, invitations you've been waiting for for so long."
"2018 will bring you slow touching, electric lights in your dreams, your favorite foods, a break in your beliefs, visions of the future, soft earth, feeling calm in a peaceful home, overheating, a surprise, a rabbit, paper clips, luxurious soaps, beaches."
"2018 will bring you happiness, card games, new awakenings, art, lamps, cheese pie, opals, a turquoise bed, an Aquarius companion, meditation, recipes for life, poetry, parties, hellos to the right person."
"2018 will bring you a date with a little bird, so many beautiful clothes, eye contact that makes you forget your name, a new best friend, the elegance of ants, a Leo, a proposal, believing in what's right, yellow, sheets, glowing orbs, grapes, hugs."
"2018 will bring you quartz, ties made of silk, people who know you when you're quiet, pet caterpillars, a clean room, a chaotic room, a Sagittarius friend, crushes, power, a book that changes your mind, an offer, a new pin, otters."
"2018 will bring you green fields, a summer adventure, fish, the ache from the beauty of a face, quiet days inside with the record player on, a light pink blanket, a pink shirt, organization, an Aries in love with you, fun, marble floors, green shoes, sun."
"2018 will bring you soothing music that plays all night, fancy cheese, kisses from another Gemini, a big prank, violet light, haze across a desert, a sad movie, teacups, an alarm clock, a cloud of new faces, a rejoicing, flowers pressed into metal, sex."
"2018 will bring you popcorn, awkward arguments, cacti, animals to host, a new beginning, jewelry made from an x-ray, the return of a Virgo, a wooden snake, a brown sweater, 2000 bursts of light, a walk into a forest, the bottom of the ocean, time."
"2018 will bring you two new lovers, a tree made of felt at your bedside, red pants, pineapple, money, new respect for yourself, a spine, dances by the light of the moon, a hero, a smitten Scorpio, blue pencils, kind people, a narrow hall."
"Sometimes you are genuinely surprised, but most of the time, you knew what was going to happen. So no excuses really. When they say bring out the roses, take one and give thanks to the moon from months ago who made this certain rose. You knew."
It's ok to feel ambivalent about the sunset. Is the magic that the hard part is over or is it about to begin. It's ok to be like what is this when all the lights ring the room. It's ok to say what's the point in an ending. It's true.
You're used to this--the hot flight from all sides. To say you thrive in such a state is to truly state the obvious. The world will create a home of crystals and ferns for you. But you will have to find it and go in.
"A very endless daydream kept you going for years. Now the actual dream has enveloped the day. Is it time to change or stay. As the winter trees shake their ice, they make more ice. There's always more. Be free."
"So many times you've felt the edge of the bed against the floor. No not literally. In your mind, you've felt where any two objects touch. As charged as any two eyes against each other. You will plant the flowers when the seasons change. Give some away."
"There are people who invite you in and give you everything and still you say, why not more. That's just your way. Deep down you know why they do it anyway. Because what place doesn't need your glamour and thoughts."
"What could be stranger than real life with its purple and green feathers against the air and sky, again and again. You ask this question of yourself and do not get an answer. You ask another person and they snore. Ask again. Nothing is like reality."
"This year is coming to a close in cold ways and so you've decided to be against parties and other types of social interaction until things turn your way again. No, you're wrong, they still turn your way. But it's ok to go into an inner dimension. It's good."
"You've torn yourself up the last few weeks trying to right the wrongs of others, despite it not being your job to do so. Take a break and feel the soft thoughts. Let someone else be in charge for once. After a few days, you will have more energy to care."
"you shall have more luck. Luck from the bottom of the earth, amethysts bursting with sparkles that line your way. You will eat delicious food and be caressed. And when people speak of you they will say nice things."
"You have so much love in your life right now, but like everything, you want more. And there can never be enough love--any sign would agree. It's just reasonable to want all those kisses. But you must know, only one kiss in so many really matters."
"As this year draws to a close, you will start to misremember everything pleasant about obsession. It will start to feel like a burden, all that energy askew. You will promise yourself you won't be consumed again. But that will be a lie, too."
"You can find the lights in what we turn on but there is another light inside a person. You see it so clearly, when they shine brightly. Was there a particular party where you met yourself as bright as anything. If so, go back there. You wait."
Slow now it will happen. So slow your speech and your actions. Slow your acting so that you can center into the person you mean. Do you mean to say that you meant what you said. Don't bother. Even you don't believe you. This week will be lucky.
"When you say, I want you, you mean you can see the next 200 years unfolding as a masterpiece. You fine tune the word go to match the time. And the clocks. The clocks the clocks the clocks. Please don't listen to them. Love."
You were quiet and you listened. No more so recorded and observed and obsessed. Or was that a different order. You put stock in. Whatever it was. That time was meant for something. You will see it spring forth like real fish from a well.
"Your heart is elsewhere. You have projected yourself in the past, the future, anywhere but here. You have taught yourself dancing because you thought they expected dancing. They didn't. You tried to laugh, and instead smiled. Go home. They long for you."
"You are so happy and everyone around you rejoices. But is there a nagging feeling in you that someone else waits for you. It's true. It is someone you know, within the day, that you seek. If you have gone to the moon landscape, you've gone too far."
"You are set up for such a bag of treats and new adventures. The way will be wild with mild and warm surprise. Despite it all they will try to make you feel sorry. Never be sorry to be alive. Never be sorry to live. It's your duty to love yourself, too."
"You found it all rather interesting. Those circles upon circles enveloping the center. The center! That's where the hurt comes from, where the green lights are coated in ice. In it you can set--the hot and violet smoke--the sign of new beginnings."
"Sometimes it really does feel that no one cares. Because they sleep and sleep and you rise at dawn and do what needs to be done. Then they sleep some more and you say, no, that's ok, I'll do it. But the trees and the moon see your heart and we do, too."
"Everyone has come to see the big and beautiful rose you've grown in your garden all year. They will gather and gather and ask how you did it. In truth, it was water and sun and also just you. You kissed that flower everyday and well, that's that."
"You are so controlled most of the time, setting a path and getting it done. Then setting another and getting that done, too. But somewhere along the way, do you long to be undone. Of course you do. But don't ask, by who? It's you."
"This time of year gets you thinking about all of the things you have done or more so, haven't done. You will feel regret, and you will feel the sting of many perceived rejections. But what if we told you--you've done just fine. Because you have."
Don't try to be honest. Some people don't like it and you aren't good at it anyway. Instead strew gold leaves all over the floor so that when they walk they will feel the weight of the sun. The dance you do is the important one.
"The funny songs will become the songs everyone sings, but you must remember you made up the funny songs and you love them so what we sing is you. You must remember that you drive the singing around and around and around again. Beware only the song."
"When we sit by the ocean we see the ways in which it moves but do we see the winds that made it move do we think about the plants and animals below the surface with their energies in abundance. No we don't, but you do."
"The night is large and wide and it has the moon. Still you ask what night road might be cool with dew, even now. The one you're on is blue-green with humor. The one you're on is the right one."
"There are so many ways to look at something. There are at least 13, but also maybe more. You get into that one way and it's strong. But is it always right--no. Start to turn the facets until you see yourself clearly again. Luck will arrive soon."
You don't own enough lamps. Do you have any lights on at all. What is it about the day that frightens you so. Should you paint the walls yellow. Should you wear a yellow suit. Yes and yes. Don't be scared of the light.
You have been wanting to travel for a long time. Your wishes are about to come true. Pack so much orange. Four winds will take you to a new place where you will dance and walk. On the way the path will be strange. That's good.
"If you feel the stirrings of what seems like spring love so early in the chill, that's not fun that's fear. Minimize everything that takes you away from what you truly love, which is a sense of family. The need is a circle."
"There is the idea of snow and then there is the snow, you know. You don't really believe in either. You broke something and you can't get it back. It's not exactly your fault. Let it go."
"If you take the picture, and everything is all set up perfectly. And the scene is exactly what you had hoped. And the smiles are neverending. All of that. Then maybe will you realize the great lie. Will you tell the truth then to someone."
"When you wake up tomorrow, whatever time it is, thank life for giving us the idea of morning. Which really means an endless beginning and isn't that what we all want. Wear purple shoes--they won't do you wrong."
"What is it about when things go awry that disturbs you so. It's control, of course, but it's also the limitation in being. We know how brief everything is. Give and take pleasure whenever it's possible."
"There will be an evening that will contain nearly everything you want but it will be missing the sweetness, the jokes. You will say you don't care. Who are you fooling. Absolutely no one, but your goal wasn't to fool anyone. This week is a magenta light."
Say hello as much as you can to as many people as you can. Soon someone will say it back and you will be thankful you said it. The person who will be waiting for it most of all is inside sleeping. Knock on that door loudly. This week is a lilac light.
"You've seen the horse run across the open field and the bear run through the trees. Have you looked long enough at the way the plants grow and where they grow from? You worship beginnings, you should. This week is a marigold light."
"You might as well admit how much you need the eyes turned in your direction. Not just turned but having been staring intently, no intensely, for several hours, no for several years. There will be luck and more luck. This week is a green light."
There is the tree but you've completely ignored that. There is the sun but you say you love the night. There are the poems but you say what is music. Here are my hands you say and we take them. This week is a silver light.
"It's all a new beginning until the smoke of the past envelops the circle. There's still a newness though, to that even, and everything else, as well. You could drink the strongest thing there is and you won't forget this. This week is a pink light."
The roses are wild and beautiful but they aren't the ones you desire. But don't pretend either to want the ones from the flower store that would be a lie. Can you just eat popcorn and forget the things with stems? No. This week is an orange light.
"People say, slow down and appreciate things, and you say, please don't tell me what to do. But to say it again, take your time. Something is beginning and you will need the energy to see it through. This week is a blue light."
"How can I help is what you ask when you mean to say, need me. So many do but not just for the ways you help them. They see you singing on the beach landscape for an interstellar cause. Baby, you'll always be beautiful this way. This week is a violet light."
"Memories can be like anger, in that they are impulsive, based on the turn of a switch. Your love for that which you seek is enduring and it endears you endlessly to the right person. You should sing softly to them. This week is a neon red light."
"If someone said to gamble to get love you would. No one is saying that. The answer is easier, more obvious. It's not the one you expect or could predict either. It could be the person you had forgotten until now. This week is an aqua light."
Why do you both love and hate watching a movie? Is it because your ego slips so cleanly into the story? A movie is a roller coaster. You'd rather swim into the unseen. This week is a yellow light.
We send you love from the life most underneath your bed. The flip side is underrated always and hardly understood. Study what moves you.
We could say the stars are patterns but you know random music is far more what breathing is. Breathe in and out and make the sea-green tree.
Under the rock are the most gorgeous neon mushrooms. Let them grow. They want you to visit whenever you can.
It's a simple fact that the more you sing the more music there is in the air. You love music but not always your own voice. You must see that you are the one who makes things a shiny yellow.
They have your back as long as you have theirs. Will you really let this go on forever? Probably.
The page with the author's name has been torn off the book. We know how deeply this excites you. Eat more desserts than you do.
What part of life is a complete waste of time? Not one fucking second.
Another walk through the woods? Try the clear path instead this time. It is pink for as long as you want it to be.
"You made that decision years ago and you were so sure about it. Yes, it's ok to change your mind. Will you? The pine has the answer."
Getting hurt is only half of the story and it's not your half. Keep being strong and the case of the sky will still have its bounce.
"Baby pictures do not tell you secrets but they do tell you how much traveling you have left to do. Yes, it's ok to linger over them."
"To water the flower you need not know if it is a golden and silver rose, you must only have water and try."
There are so many love songs you could sing to calm your nerves but being calm right now is overwhelming. Listen to the silly songs and you will feel a new energy and you will say to the person you love let's start laughing and they will.
You want to say that you're wrong but you also know that you're right. If you could measure life in moods it would be very long. You want to say all the people you knew before were close to you. And you'd be right--they were.
"You are a bird and you are glittery blue. Fly around and see the way you match the buildings and the air. And when you are ready, find a car to escape inside and let someone take you to a gorgeous forest and you will get even more famous there."
Rest you gentle person who is full of life and horses. The neverending lake is steaming so go in and you can forget everything that angers you in the heat. And the lake is purple with purple moss and everyone who is real is there.
It's late. And they are already there. And you sleep and dream of an endless plate of sandwiches. And you will tell yourself after you wake up that you can't remember what kind of sandwiches they were. And you will lie to save their feelings.
"Get a very elegant card and write a note in sky blue letters to a person you admire. Then take the card and hold it up a mirror and say out loud, is this what I admire? Then take a yellow note pad and write a thank you note to yourself for being awesome."
"We wish and we wish and we wish and then we say wishing is only for the ideas of what wishing was and we make wishing places and go to them. And you say, what's a wish, and then you do. And then you do some more. And you know what, it's great."
A necklace of clear glass beads and clear plastic faceted beads and see-thru letters that spell out the word seashell and lots of clear diamonds that are blissfully unreal. All of this bores you and maybe it should.
"You can hide all you want. And you can say lies are beautiful and maybe they are. And you can say this is my way of having my own space in my mind that they can't take up, and you'd be right. And whatever you have to do to have that is ok."
There is a story of a very lonely wave in the ocean who kept pushing and pushing towards the shore and pushing and pushing and one day they said no I was wrong let me go back to the world and then they did.
You know the answer but you will keep asking the questions because the asking is fun. You know the song but you will keep asking if the song is for you. You know it is. Who else would it be for.
Take at least two baths a day and wear purple underwear and eat lemon cake and kiss a lot. And then kiss some more.
You're a star no matter what you do. So help us be less lonely. Because you love us and we love you.
Being nice can get you so much. Layer upon layer upon more nice. And kindness. So much of it is good.
"When you get sad, everything else does, too. Everything waits for those few moments when you laugh, to bloom."
"If you knew in the next two weeks you will change your mind, would you change it now? No, of course not. So."
Things will happen and they will be beautiful things. Trust in butter and layers of golden sparks. Make eye contact.
Remember the past as the way a painting remembers its canvas before the act--as an opposite. Wear new red shoes.
"You shouldn't feel this way, but you do. You can question it all you want. There is nothing but these feelings."
"It's scary, but necessary. But it's scary. But you're very strong. But strength is not humor. No. No it's not."
O bright lights. O bright skies. O silent unfathomable eyes. O bronze and copper and the sun. O everything.
"A fondness echoes thru the landscape, but is it yours? No, it was the things that were fond of you! So many."
Sad but true--what you don't know can hurt you. So you must know it all. Bid the choir adieu.
"The moon aches with sarcasm. Only you can hear its cries. Don't answer back. For power, eat red peppers."
"The person telling jokes does not mean well. The person singing sad songs is your friend. For power, eat avocados."
"If you dress the room in lights will it be bright enough for everyone? For you? For power, eat onions."
"The poem that is written about the sun is waiting for you, but you have to write it. For power, eat corn."
"Sometimes the things that take the most time to be real are the least real. For power, eat peppermint candy."
"It's hard to change. But it was harder for you to make the decision to change. So do it now. For power, eat coconuts."
"Rest for hours at the entryway of the building. Don't let anyone determine who you will be. For power, eat beets."
"Invite your crush to walk among the trees. Walk slowly. Listen, because every song is for you. For power, eat garlic."
"The lesson in the book is for another lifetime. The important lesson you already learned. For power, eat peas."
"You feel rejected. But really you are in love. Take many baths. For power, eat grapes."
"There are four gates, but only one is locked. Kiss a lot of people. For power, eat cookies."
"Beware of all the bad energy in hot pink. Don't gamble. For power, eat carrots."

"Draw 11 ovals and inside the smallest oval look strongly into it, then imagine you are that purple glowing flower."
"Don't bake the cake. Don't buy the cake. Eat donuts. Try to remember you love pie. Eat cookies, (but spicy ones)."
If you can feel then it's not real but it might as well be. If you can see it then you should be applauded.
"Is adventure best in groups or alone? The answer is neither, but you didn't ask the question. Try to laugh."
Stop being such a tease. They want you but the whole heart of you. Just like when you really want something.
Rest your eyes not by sleeping but by staying active. Look at a picture of a lion and say aloud how you are one.
Don't wear the amethyst unless you're prepared to feel everything. Massage your eyebrows. Order too many desserts.
No one likes a gossip. But everyone likes you. You figure it out. (But do it while dancing in circles.)
If you've fallen behind it's cause someone else set the pace. Remember the advice you would give. Do the opposite.
"For you love is like one very long day. For everyone else you are the day. This time, be just the afternoon."
Find the clearing in the forest and wait there for a while. Eventually you will hear voices that say more than me.
"Take your crush to the most obnoxiously popular museum you can find and if they are into it, it's true love."
"This all was so hard, but also a necessity to the way things must be. Borrow bunches and bunches of yellow flowers."
Can you be generous and protect yourself at the same time? This time you have to try to do both. You=pure love.
"All this velvet. All this glorious purple and dark red velvet, and a cup made of pure gold, full of real coins."
"Leave your bed, and when you do that, leave your house, and after that, leave your city. Then go to the moon."
"For all the moods and costumes, you are truly a consistent person. Find someone who will never believe that."
You have so much empathy that it keeps you from seeing greed and someone right next to you is very selfish. Beware.
"There are two piles of riches divided among five people, but please choose the sixth person. They contain all."
You love a group of friends around you constantly but now you will seek a solitary sport. That's the good news.
"If we say to jump in the water passionately right now, it's not a joke or euphemism. Go fast to the literal wave."
You can't pretend to like the things you can't see. You only love what you see. Buy three blue things for your bed.
All that follow through is energy just for you. It's a gift to yourself. Wrap up your light in ribbons and rejoice.
Being obsessed with someone is a kind of gift they almost never deserve and surprise they don't now. Wear baby pink.
When it gets too much look into an orb. Any circle tells you the future. The full circle tells how to get there.
Is it fair to always be the one carrying roses. It depends--do you like flowers. Don't answer. You are the dancer.
You can make anything sound like the most exciting thing to ever be. Is this a talent or a curse. Wear silver.
"Before the party we look the best. But after the party we are most ourselves. We know, who needs parties."
They love you and they always have. We can't tell you how to feel about that. But we know you know how you feel.
Quiet your instincts--what you think are your instincts are really your light. Write a sonnet to an opal. That's you.
This is your time so don't worry about what happens next. Buy several pieces of lapis and find a way to make a crown.
"You can be the person who stares at the hot one  from across the room if it's necessary. Trust us, it's not necessary."
Take your most cherished piece of precious red object and press it to your forehead. You will see the answer again.
"If we told you you would get the thing, would you stop crying. Probably not, but here we are comforting you anyway."
It isn't the pictures that you long for--it is the moments after the pictures are seen and everyone loves you.

"When you decorate your room don't forget orange. If you have forgotten, add it now. Orange goes with the sea"
"The one you miss misses someone else. The one you love loves you and the sea. The one you know knows you, so well"
"When a place is adorned in wood, it's a very nice place. That's your room--with wood on the ceiling. Learn there"
It's all happening. Do not sleep. It's all happening for you now and you need to see it all through and be
How long will you stay? Will you wait until you are utterly and completely bored? The butterflies are for you
You could talk to anyone and make them care. But you shouldn't. The more people the harder this will be
We mean it so seriously--this time belongs to you. Treat it like a sacred thing to carry with you. Life expands
You could write a novel about all you've seen lately. But why bother? It's not a story you were meant for--it's a play
You will go away to someplace surprising. Not the going away but what you think of it. Gather everything into ideas
Only once you are in your rhythm do you find the way to be the wildest. But only once. Don't mistake rut for rhythm
In the faces of the leaves still on the trees is a song only you can hear. Do you keep it to yourself or share? Both
In your lifetime you won't see the face of the secret voice you carry with you everywhere. Learn to be ok with that.
You are young and wild so be one with the drive. Take walks whenever possible. Be soulmates with a Cancer.
We think it's important to note that kissing isn't cheating. Be free with your affect. Argue with a Scorpio.
Who are your real friends? Thank them now for being true. You will need them this week. Fuck a Leo.
There are people in life who are there just to make you see your true self. Have you found them? Hug a Taurus.
The boundary is only thin when the evening is the most far away. Do not be fooled by the night. Seduce an Aries.
You must act to change things. Do you actually want to change things? Do you want to change? Copy a Virgo's style.
You can't always be in the right. We know you know that's not the point. But do you know that. Call a Libra.
There are so many things to see and do. But the most important spectacle is you. The lights go in. Kiss a Sagittarius.
You care you care you care. But no one else does. Except the one you love. Listen to a Capricorn.
Is the party the thing with all the people or is the party in the silent room. Your choice. Love an Aquarius.
A pattern is only a pattern when it occurs more than twice. How many times have you walked away. Beware a Pisces.
Everyone else creates noise to serve themselves. Listen to your own noise. What peace. Be careful with Geminis.
When you feel the hollow core of the sky remember the air is just as rich with life as the sea.
It's very simple to find the complex answer. The hardest question is one without an answer. Know courage first.
"When you think of your friend, the one who has lasted thru all of time and more, give a gift of quartz and honey."
You will find the way and when the cold dawn opens its heart know that you've found your truest friend.
When you think you've lost what you've came here for you must know the one you came here for waits for you.
"Change is hard, for everyone. When you feel scared and alone, remember we are but one beating thing."
"The bed is long and narrow, but it has infinite blankets. When you feel the door open, you have felt the moon."
"The one in purple also wears a purple hat. When they say not to laugh, laugh more. Rejoice, for you it's always spring."
When time falls like curtains know it's been only one long day and the night with all its lights is yet to come.
"When they put you in the room so that they can't hear you realize the room is an illusion you've made up, and sing."
"When you feel like giving up, remember you are the one who is not just from the forest, but is the forest."
"When you think of the one you really love, remember everything they do they do for you. When you're sad, sit down."
You can't make the rules apply to everyone. Forget rules. Trust a Cancer this week with your festivities.
Romance is everywhere but you've made it clear what you want is power. Trust a Capricorn this week with your past.
What circles back circles back and back again. Don't fear the cycle. Trust a Gemini this week with your ideas.
You cannot control life and this brings you more joy than dread. Trust a Leo this week with your music.
What brings you peace is not passing it's a new way to be. Trust an Aquarius this week with your language.
Please be sure before you decide not to care. We urge you to care. Trust a Sagittarius this week with your soul.
You have let the ones with questions ask you anything. Now ask them to go. Trust an Aries this week with your eyes.
"To truly win you must want to win, but you don't want to win you want to live. Trust a Libra this week with your style."
The silent weather of the heart is only addictive when you're lost. Trust a Virgo this week with your future.
"They say that music lives outside the self, but they are wrong. Trust a Scorpio this week with your mind."
Memory is a place where we live forever. In the imagination we live today. Trust a Pisces this week with your money.
"You may have convinced yourself it's over, but it is very much not over. Trust a Taurus this week with your heart."
Maybe once you should pick up the spilled flowers on the street meant for someone else
Count the days between rainfall and rainfall once and then stop counting...for a long time
You'll need to remember that to touch another animal without being afraid is possible in every season
You will make a home in the night but you won't always live there
The way to stop dreaming of fires is to go out and let the air impress you by asking nothing of it
So many people will walk through you and leave the light on for when you need it most
Wouldn't you take the moon into your bedroom if like you it had no use for the past
Sometimes everything is best felt in silence and with the eyes
Looking up at the sky is only important when you know what you're willing to find
"Even horses run through the familiar once in a while and stay, so stay"
If all could be taken back you'd still invest in love so let yourself continue without question
Walking alone through every room you are making your way toward the trees who know your loneliness
"Maybe you think the imperfect tunnel will get you nowhere. But you're wrong, it goes there, too."
"You've been walking and walking and then in the distance you can feel the sea. Before you get there, sleep."
Is it the light in the hall that brings you comfort? Or is it falling asleep in the blinding light? Don't answer.
A blue butterfly. A blue and red butterfly is the solace you seek. You will have to wait so long to see it.
"You are finally alone in the house. So what do you do? You call for them, of course. Oh you call and call."
Be strong be strong be strong. Oh you are very strong. How strong you think you are--you are stronger.
Just because it seems fair in a book doesn't mean it's fair from your mouth. The moths fly higher and higher. Look.
"What if day were night? Would you settle in to that banality, too? Or would you ask for the whole thing to be the day?"
Maybe they don't actually want all that you're offering. Maybe riches seen in the heart don't interest anyone.
"Just because it's new to you doesn't mean it's new to everyone else. Still, keep your wonder, it keeps you well."
Sometimes winning an argument is the worst thing that could happen. Concentrate instead on winning them over.
"Imagine all the things you've ever wanted in front of you. Would you take them all? If you say yes, then keep trying."
Working from the emotional center has saved even more than people. Watch the eclipse with another Pisces.
Some things stay lost even if called back and so be it. Watch the eclipse with a Gemini.
Who would walk in the garden at midnight without looking for love? Watch the eclipse with a Libra.
Everyone is talking about you and for once you're not paying attention. Watch the eclipse with an Aries.
Everything is turning toward luck even the gold at the bottom of the well. Watch the eclipse alone.
Your inner life is more important than the exterior you've been cultivating. Watch the eclipse with a Capricorn.
"Becoming dull is easy, surrounding yourself w real living people is not. Watch the eclipse w a Cancer or Sagittarius."
Don't trade fire for earth. It's enticing but empty. Watch the eclipse with another Leo.
Even giving up your soul to the right person saves no one. Watch the eclipse with a Virgo.
Some people talk about the wind and some people are the wind. Watch the eclipse with an Aquarius.
Crazy little thing called obsession turning into love. Let it. Watch the eclipse with a Scorpio.
Often walking toward the sun feels like getting lost in hell. Watch the eclipse with a Sagittarius.

"Don't keep waiting for the right moment. Moments are not real. To feel free, write a poem for a stoplight."

A few years ago you loved sewing but then you stopped you said due to time. Connect back to the music of the needle.
A few years ago you were wary of being truly hopeful but you were anyway. Connect back to the blooming wind.
"A few years you searched for the friend who was  there searching, too. Connect back to the search and the friend."
A few years ago you were consumed by others' moods but now you know they mean nothing. Connect back to the sea.
A few years ago you thought the purpose was to drive out the grey with force. Connect back to what made you sure.
A few years ago you promised you'd create more and you did but there is still more to do. Connect back to the reason.
A few years ago you thought it would be easier than it was but you've liked it that much more. Connect back to purity.
A few years ago you went through the motions but it made you happy not empty. Connect back to the gear and be peaceful.
A few years ago you gave a friend advice and knew it was the wrong advice. Connect back to what you said and be free.
A few years ago you were a different person and you mourn this person. Connect back to them and you will have luck.
"A few years ago you said the work was done cause you were tired, not cause it was. Connect back to it and live 4ever."
A few years ago you underestimated how awesome you are. Connect back to what makes you so and you will be on the path.
All Pisces are set designers. This week take the curtain down and put the chairs in the crowd. Decorate in quartz.
All Aquarians are clocks. This week mark not what is incremental but what moves through the wind and rain.
All Capricorns are sculptors. This week take what exists and recreate it into a set of hosts of the thing itself.
All Sagittarians are plants. The things that create the imprint of air are the most alive. Hold life in breeze.
All Scorpios are windows. This week remember that what you sense is there even more so. All windows make a song.
All Libras are painters. This week keep in mind that all that we touch has another life in the mind as form.
All Virgos are lights. This week illuminate for all that surrounds you and then see how the top of your being shines.
All Leos are doctors. When you see the fight you fight to help. This week fix what you can but heal everything.

All Aries are dancers. This week move away from stress with grace. Create a pretty scene with joyful ribbons.

You heard the cry of the dream but did you know that was you crying for the dream. Hurt no more and dream forever.
Dreams are not the point. Hurting is not the point. Feeling is pointless. Sleep sleep. Sleep into the dream.
"Dreams are not real you tell everyone, but do you believe? Hurting is not real but do you believe."
You will never forget the dream. You will never forget the hurt. But will you go so far away and forget it all.
A dream chilled is a dream that cannot be. But when you hurt the dream it reheats and breathes. Love the dream.
"Deep is the dream when you have gone into what can't hurt you. When you speak, you lace the afternoon with the dream."
"Dreams are sweet when half-awake, but sweeter when in the space between. What hurts is sweetest."
"If you could only dream you would but you must be awake, too. Awaken to what hurts and you will see it is the dream."
You've gone far from the dream in the sleep that is in the night. The dream is now in the day. The day hurts.
Dream the one dream which is many. Dream the one dream that makes dance in the dream. Hurt only while dancing.
"new love, new life, new experiences. Dream with purpose to make things. Hurt for it all to be."
"Even though your heart says it's futile, dream of a time where joy bursts thru everything. The hurt is in the past."
Your vulnerability will be rewarded if it grows and is much of you. Let go of being cold as a form of protection.
People aren't problems to fix. They are their own energy. Let go of false obsession.
"If you isolate the one thing you're passionate about, you'll find the many others. Let go of distraction."
On paper it's close. But love &amp; friendship aren't things on paper. You're vast. You make things happen. Let go.
"Even though you find power in your darkness, let it inform almost nothing this week. Let go of control."
Don't be the mannequin waiting to be looked at. They aren't even real. Let go of expecting less.
"There's someone who loves you arriving like a slow, late train. Let them do it in their way. Let go of letting go."
"If you don't ask for what you want, who you want, you won't get either. Let go of being complacent with what is safe."
Tell someone you love a secret in a park &amp; listen to what they have to say. Let go of feeling like you're a martyr.
One of these mornings walk out of the house &amp; don't return until you've imagined it all differently. Let go of shame
When the internal changes the external follows. Don't try the other way. Let go of one thing having to do with fear.
It's been a while since you've done something alone. Do so. Let go of one thing having to do with lust.
Don't listen with attention for the moon. Listen to the calls of the places we can go to everyday and make a song.
Don't listen for the story that never ends. Listen carefully to the ending and learn.
Don't listen to recordings of the past because they are contained. Listen to sounds you hear as you are sleeping.
Don't listen to the relentless ones saying no. Listen to your voice inside which never says anything but yes.
Don't listen to the clapping hands you have secretly been waiting for this whole time. Listen for the sweet touch.
Don't listen as the heavy emptiness follows you. Listen as the ringing metal bounces back upon the silence for you.
Don't listen for the sound of worms everywhere. Listen to what you do to the daylight as you listen to the sea.
Don't listen to your doubt that fills the room. Listen for the sound of your majestic song that breaks the air.
Don't listen to the future you can't yet see. Listen as the record player of the present skips and skips.
Don't listen to the pain that has kept you locked inside the room. Listen for the warmth of voices who call for you.
"Don't listen to the rain for too long waiting for it to stop. Listen only for the sound of snow, which is silent."
Don't listen to the happy ones who are eager to say goodbye. Listen to the angry ones who never leave your side.
If you lift the veil between you and the person you're obsessed with you'll see a vast sky. Confide in a Taurus.
Paint something green. Pick or buy 3 different types of flowers &amp; keep them near your bed. Confide in a Cancer.
What you want is a little farther down than what's in front of you. Don't take the short cut. Confide in a Leo.
You know what to change in order to become yourself. It's a greater risk to stay the same. Confide in yourself.
Time is long. There are many love affairs to be had. Focus on what could be a big career move. Confide in a Libra.
"Leave the old—place, lover, obsession. The new life needs to be written down first. Do it. Confide in a Pisces."
You'll learn an important lesson in seeing that everyone comes around on their own time. Confide in a Sagittarius.
"The ambitious, star-quality, forward thinking Leo is the real Leo. Don't be scared of them. Confide in a Scorpio."
